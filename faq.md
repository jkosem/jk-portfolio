# FAQ

### What do you call yourself?

I got by many titles: interaction designer, service designer, user researcher, consultant, information designer, product strategy consultant, writer, presenter, advisor and overall nice guy.

### But which is your specialty?

That's easy, it's design. I think all of it in one or another is design. All of it in one way or another are ways to solve a problem with creative intent.

### You have quite a broad experience. Don't you think you should stick with one thing?

Not necessarily. Generalists have the advantage of being able to see problems and solutions from many angles and from many experiences.
