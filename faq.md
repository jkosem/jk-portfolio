# FAQ

#### What do you call yourself exactly?

I go by many titles: interaction designer, service designer, user researcher, consultant, information designer, product strategy consultant, writer, presenter, advisor and overall nice guy.

#### But which is your specialty?

That's easy, it's design. I think all of it in one or another is design. All of it in one way or another are ways to solve a problem with creative intent.

I design. Sometimes that's an interface. Sometimes it's lots of screens. Sometimes it's extensive maps and documentation. Itâ€™s all design. Just like researching who might be using the wider service in which that sits, whether it be on a London housing estate or a village in Rwanda. Likewise, that means developing the strategy of a product or service, because that is helping find out what to design.

#### How do you say in a sentence what you do?

I work on products and services with impact and scale like government, a fairer and more secure peer-to-peer internet to reinventing what used to be email.

#### You have quite a broad experience. Don't you think you should stick with one thing?

Not really. Generalists have the advantage of being able to see problems and solutions from many angles and from many experiences.

Design should be a very broad practice, calling upon all the ways we can think of and use to solve our world's problems. Sometime a well written sentence can do the job of an entire application and sometimes you need to work at what not to design.
