# README

This readme is a work-in-progress obviously, but I'm posting links to things I've found helpful. Oh yeah, by the way, the entire thing was pulled together from all of the links and more stuff cast about all over the internets to build the Frankenstein site you have before you.

## Dependencies

Ruby 2.6 and above (to get this version working at any rate)

Jekyll 4.1 and above

All the hosting is done on the Github page. Link over up there on the right with the URL.

## How to use
=======
> This readme is a work-in-progress obviously

A lot of the things here worked
>>>>>>> parent of 2f59630... semi working blog with update section on index

1. Have everything installed like above, namely Ruby and Jekyll
2. Need to build `jekyll build` to release
3. Can also, whilst developing, use `jekyll serve --livereload` which will upon saving, reload the file in browser at `http://localhost:4000/`
4. Need to `git add .`, `git commit -m <message>` and `git push` to get it to GitHub to get it to be available at URL

## Links, reference, etc.

A lot of the things [here](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/3984) worked

[This page](https://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/mydoc_install_jekyll_on_mac.html) was also helpful

[This tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LhLFeuvc38) was probably the easiest to follow

This guy has a good post on [How to Make a Jekyll Site/Blog](https://brianm.me/posts/how-to-make-jekyll-site-blog)

I nicked a lot of things on how to do posts from [here](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/build-a-jekyll-site/).
