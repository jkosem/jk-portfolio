# README

This readme is a work-in-progress obviously, but I'm posting links to things I've found helpful. Oh yeah, by the way, the entire thing was pulled together from all of the links and more stuff cast about all over the internets to build the Frankenstein site you have before you.

## Dependencies

Ruby 2.6 and above (to get this version working at any rate)

Jekyll 4.1 and above

All the hosting is done on the Github page. Link over up there on the right with the URL.

## Links, reference, etc.
