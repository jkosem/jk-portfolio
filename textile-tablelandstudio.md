# Textile Tableland Studio

## Overview & Challenge

[Textile](https://www.textile.io) is a data technology company, with the mission to enable open, accessible, and free information by build open technologies backed by open processes.

Much of my work at Textile was on [Tableland](https://tableland.xyz/), and in particular [Tableland Studio](https://studio.tableland.xyz/), which is an open source, permissionless cloud database built on SQLite. Our mission was to take various console and command line tools, which were the only way to use Tableland and build out a complete web application whilst building the community to use and support Tableland.

## Role & Approach

As the lead product designer at Textile, I led the introduction and led the user-centred research and UX/UI design practices for the company and for Tableland. This included working with the developers on not just the design of the product, but also helping move the design into production.

## Results

* Designed user research and helped recruit research participants
* Introduced user research methods, tested product design through prototypes, conducted user interviews and compiled analysis and recommendations
* Led the product design of a complete move from Command Line Interface (CLI) to web app GUI
* Setup analytics and created product design and direction recommendations
* Designed the various iterations of the interface and integration into front-end development
* Performed design advocacy and worked to establish user-centred, design thinking.
