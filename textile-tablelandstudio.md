# Textile Tableland Studio

## Overview & Challenge

[Textile](https://www.textile.io) is a data technology company, with the mission to enable open, accessible, and free information by build open technologies backed by open processes.

## Role & Approach

As the lead product designer at Textile, I led introduction of user-centred research and design practices to the company, enacting them with the development of Studio.

Much of my work at Textile was on Tableland, and in particular [Tableland Studio](https://studio.tableland.xyz/), which is an open source, permissionless cloud database built on SQLite. Our mission was to take various console and command line tools and build out a complete web application whilst building the community to use and support Tableland.

## Results

* Helped recruiting of participants for user research
* Introduced and conducted user research methods and testing of product thinking and design
* Led the creation of a complete move from Command Line Interface (CLI) to GUI
* Setup analytics and created product design and direction recommendations based on those
* Performed design advocacy and introduced a culture of user-centred design
