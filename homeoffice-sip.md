# Home Office Single Intelligence Platform

SIP (Single Intelligence Platform) is a platform for UK Border Force to write, analyse, check and share intelligence and connect the dots in investigations across the entire agency.

I was the design lead and liased between the product, front-end and research teams to revolutionise how the Home Office and Border Force fought border crime. This they did by cutting case handling time in half.
