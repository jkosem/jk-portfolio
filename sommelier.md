# Sommelier

![](assets/images/sommelier-set.png)

I was the (co)product manager and design lead on developing a second screen platform that knows what you're watching on your TV in real time and shows you on iPad in a calm and clear manner everything from maps to recipes as they happen. It utilised AI techniques like Natural Language Processing to process and curate content in real time. (Under NDA and for an extremely large, global, tech company).
