title: "Jim Kosem: Design, strategy & research"
---

### Hi, I'm Jim.

## I work across design, research and strategy to make emerging technologies practical realities.

I work on products and services with impact and scale like government, a fairer and more secure peer-to-peer internet to reinventing what used to be email.

I design. Sometimes that's an interface. Sometimes it's lots of screens. Sometimes it's extensive maps and documentation. Itâ€™s all design. Just like researching who might be using the wider service in which that sits, whether it be on a London housing estate or a village in Rwanda. Likewise, that means developing the strategy of a product or service, because that is helping find out what to design.

Design should be a very broad practice, calling upon all the ways we can think of and use to solve our world's problems. Sometime a well written sentence can do the job of an entire application and sometimes you need to work at what not to design.
