# Hi, I'm Jim

I work across design, research, strategy and making emerging technologies practical realities.

I work on products and services with scale and impact and that have or can scale like government, a newer and fairer peer-to-peer internet to reinventing what used to be email.

I can design an interface. Itâ€™s part of the job. Just like researching who might be using the wider service in which that sits, whether it be on a London housing estate or a village in Rwanda. Likewise, that means developing the strategy of a product or service, because that is helping find out what to design.

You might be wondering about what it is I do and how varied things seem to be. I get that. I believe design to be a very broad practice, calling upon all the ways we can think of and use to solve our worlds problems. Sometime a well written sentence can do the job of half of an application and sometimes you need to work at what not to design.
