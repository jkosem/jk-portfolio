# Design, research & strategy

Hi, I'm Jim and I work across design, research and strategy. This is to make emerging technologies practical realities, design systems that are liveable for everyone and help culture fit into our lives today and in the future. To find out more about the specifics, you might want to check out the [FAQ](faq.html).

Here are a few examples of what all of this looks like:

Design should be a very broad practice, calling upon all the ways we can think of and use to solve our world's problems. Sometime a well written sentence can do the job of an entire application and sometimes you need to work at what not to design.
