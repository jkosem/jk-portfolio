# Now

This is what I've been up to lately, and as a concept unashamedly ripped off of Derek Sivers.

## What I’m looking into

- Micropayments and why
- Blockchain that isn’t defi (decentralised finance) and why

## What I’m working on

### Jekyll and static site generators

I've been building websites since I can remember when, but generally manually and very infrequently. In the past decade[^1], it's largely been with Wordpress. I like Wordpress and still using it, but since started using Jekyll and Github pages for this very site to get down into the nitty gritty. There's just something incredibly satisfying about actually making the thing yourself and I beginning to fall back in love with CSS like it's high school or something.
