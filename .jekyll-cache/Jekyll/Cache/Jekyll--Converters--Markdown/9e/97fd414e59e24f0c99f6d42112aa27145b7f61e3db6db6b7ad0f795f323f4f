<p><a href="https://www.sedna.com">SEDNA</a> is a scale-up, venture capital funded company solving team communications at scale. I began work with SEDNA freelance to help with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_design">category design</a> (not able to be shown) defining how to redesign email and high volume communications. This then laid out the need for a full-time position, initially as a senior designer and then as a design lead.</p>

<p>Most of my work at SEDNA has been about building the team, practice and processes to take an unintuitive interface requiring days of training and potential weeks of support to a more user-friendly and powerful enterprise application for users.</p>
