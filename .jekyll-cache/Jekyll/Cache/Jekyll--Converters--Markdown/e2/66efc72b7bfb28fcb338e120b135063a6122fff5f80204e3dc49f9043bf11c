<p>DeepWork was tasked with taking an algorithmic trading platform from command line (CLI) to graphical interface (GUI). I helped to design the user experience and graphical interface, as well as conduct user research and facilitate co-creation workshops.</p>

<p>The work presented numerous challenges, including how to help users understand building and deploying bots and developing and collaborating on financial strategies. We collaborated on and co-created a solution where the user could not only setup and manage bots that would do crypto trades for them, but could also publish these bots.</p>

<p>We validated the product and features before a costly building phase, conducted user testing and quickly learned if the team was on the right path.</p>

<p>The bots users would create could be stopped, started and even scheduled and we designed clear visualisation of how their trading strategy is working out, and how profitable theyâ€™ve been.</p>
