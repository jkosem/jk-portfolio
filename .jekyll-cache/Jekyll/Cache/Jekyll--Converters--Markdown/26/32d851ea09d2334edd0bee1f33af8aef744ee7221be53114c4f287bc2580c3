<h3 id="i-work-across-design-research-and-strategy-to-make-emerging-technologies-practical-realities">I work across design, research and strategy to make emerging technologies practical realities.</h3>

<p>I work on products and services with impact and scale like government, a newer and fairer peer-to-peer internet to reinventing what used to be email.</p>

<p>I design. Sometimes thatâ€™s an interface. Sometimes itâ€™s lots of screens. Sometimes itâ€™s extensive maps and documentation. Itâ€™s all design. Just like researching who might be using the wider service in which that sits, whether it be on a London housing estate or a village in Rwanda. Likewise, that means developing the strategy of a product or service, because that is helping find out what to design.</p>

<p>You might be wondering about what it is I do and how varied things seem to be. I get that. I believe design to be a very broad practice, calling upon all the ways we can think of and use to solve our worlds problems. Sometime a well written sentence can do the job of half of an application and sometimes you need to work at what not to design.</p>
