<p>Civil Legal Aid was the first completely redesigned government digital service which helped people in need get free legal help.</p>

<p>Through extensive user research and service design we mapped out and completely overhauled the entire service.</p>

<p>Users now had a way to fill out the simplest form possible rather than spend hours with multiple solicitors and legal advisors.</p>

<p>The administrative backend was completely built from scratch sprint by sprint and with it developed the first government digital transformation admin design system.</p>
