# MyLens

Imagine a world where you could hand out subscriptions to your contact details to people and companies that you could mask and revoke at any time? We designed and prototyped a controlled data market (called an agent) that allows the user to advertise particular parts of themselves.

The use can advertise bits of themselves to brands for certain periods directly to brands and companies. The brand can then offer deals in exchange for not being able to target potential customers so specifically.

In this case the user accepts a contact lens request and then they can receive and control the messaging between them.

Every MyLens user has a profile that they maintain the access levels for each of their means of contact.
