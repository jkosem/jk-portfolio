<h3 id="what-do-you-call-yourself-exactly">What do you call yourself exactly?</h3>

<p>I go by many titles: interaction designer, service designer, user researcher, consultant, information designer, product strategy consultant, writer, presenter, advisor and overall nice guy.</p>

<h3 id="but-which-is-your-specialty">But which is your specialty?</h3>

<p>That’s easy, it’s design. I think all of it in one or another is design. All of it in one way or another are ways to solve a problem with creative intent.</p>

<h3 id="you-have-quite-a-broad-experience-dont-you-think-you-should-stick-with-one-thing">You have quite a broad experience. Don’t you think you should stick with one thing?</h3>

<p>Not really. Generalists have the advantage of being able to see problems and solutions from many angles and from many experiences.</p>
